# Snake-Game
A classic Snake Game built using Python and the Pygame library. Guide the snake to eat the green food blocks to grow longer while avoiding the edges of the screen and the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the wall. As the snake grows, the challenge increases as there is less space to move!
